		<ul>
			<li><strong>CKIT501 Computer Structures</strong></li>
				<p>
					This module covers everything from computer
					architecture to databases, algorithms, languages,
					operating systems, communications, computer networks,
					artificial intelligence and the theoretical
					foundations of computation. It will give you a sound
					theoretical and practical grounding on which to build
					your understanding of future technical developments.
				</p>
			<li><strong>CKIT522 Professional Issues in Computing</strong></li>
				<p>
					This module examines the relationship between IT,
					society and the law. It helps develop an understanding
					of external matters affecting computer systems and
					organisations, provides an overview of professional
					and ethical issues and develops the skills required to
					manage systems in a way that is both effective and
					sensitive to their operating environment.
				</p>
			<li><strong>CKIT507 Software Engineering</strong></li>
				<p>
					This module encompasses the theoretical foundation and
					practice of the three key phases of problem definition,
					software development and maintenance. It covers
					identification, definition, design, analysis, verification
					and management of basic requirements, coding, testing,
					evaluation and quality assurance. You will emerge equipped
					to lead a programming project and deliver products on time
					and within budget.
				</p>
			<li><strong>CKIT510 Object-Oriented Programming in Java</strong></li>
				<p>
					This module develops the essential problem-solving and
					programming skills you need to write well structured
					object-oriented programs in Java. On the way you will
					explore many other important techniques (such as modern
					distributed systems and component technology) based on
					the concepts that have made objectoriented programming
					todayâ€™s predominant software development method.
				</p>
			<li><strong>CKIT515 Object Oriented Analysis and Design</strong></li>
				<p>
					This module takes a modern objectoriented approach to
					modelling systems and producing designs for software
					packages that can automate those systems. It will
					provide the skills you need to master this technique,
					as well as how to use the Unified Modelling Language
					(UML) to describe these models.
				</p>
			<li><strong>CKIT518 Software testing and QA Management</strong></li>
				<p>
					This module provides the techniques you need to design
					and implement tests, conduct inspections and employ
					release and maintenance procedures. It also addresses
					key management aspects of the quality assurance process.
				</p>
			<li><strong>CKIT514 IT Project Management</strong></li>
				<p>
					This module shows how technology project management adapts
					to the evolution of a computer system from concept to
					implementation. You will master all areas of the subject,
					including organisation, work breakdown structure and
					scheduling, resources and project financing, project control
					and evaluation, management considerations, critical success
					factors and risk management.
				</p>

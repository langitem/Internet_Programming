		<ul>
			<li><strong>CKIT501 Computer Structures</strong></li>
				<!-- nested ordered list -->
				<ol>
					<li>Summary:</li>
					<p>
						This module covers everything from computer
						architecture to databases, algorithms, languages,
						operating systems, communications, computer networks,
						artificial intelligence and the theoretical
						foundations of computation. It will give you a sound
						theoretical and practical grounding on which to build
						your understanding of future technical developments.</p>
					<li>Aim:</li>
					<p>
						To provide a comprehensive overview of core software and hardware technologies.
					</p>
				</ol>
			<li><strong>CKIT522 Professional Issues in Computing</strong></li>
				<!-- nested ordered list -->
				<ol>
					<li>Summary:</li>
					<p>
						This module examines the relationship between IT,
						society and the law. It helps develop an understanding
						of external matters affecting computer systems and
						organisations, provides an overview of professional
						and ethical issues and develops the skills required to
						manage systems in a way that is both effective and
						sensitive to their operating environment.
					</p>
					<li>Aim:</li>
					<p>
						To provide a broad understanding of the social and legal
						context in which information technology operates.
					</p>
				</ol>
			<li><strong>CKIT507 Software Engineering</strong></li>
				<!-- nested ordered list -->
				<ol>
					<li>Summary:</li>
					<p>
						This module encompasses the theoretical foundation and
						practice of the three key phases of problem definition,
						software development and maintenance. It covers
						identification, definition, design, analysis, verification
						and management of basic requirements, coding, testing,
						evaluation and quality assurance. You will emerge equipped
						to lead a programming project and deliver products on time
						and within budget.
					</p>
					<li>Aim:</li>
					<p>
						To provide a firm theoretical foundation and practical skills in software engineering.
					</p>
				</ol>
			<li><strong>CKIT510 Object-Oriented Programming in Java</strong></li>
				<!-- nested ordered list -->
				<ol>
					<li>Summary:</li>
					<p>
						This module develops the essential problem-solving and
						programming skills you need to write well structured
						object-oriented programs in Java. On the way you will
						explore many other important techniques (such as modern
						distributed systems and component technology) based on
						the concepts that have made objectoriented programming
						todayâ€™s predominant software development method.
					</p>
					<li>Aim:</li>
					<p>
						To provide a theoretical and practical understanding of
						objectoriented programming and design using Java.
					</p>
				</ol>
			<li><strong>CKIT515 Object Oriented Analysis and Design</strong></li>
				<!-- nested ordered list -->
				<ol>
					<li>Summary:</li>
					<p>
						This module takes a modern objectoriented approach to
						modelling systems and producing designs for software
						packages that can automate those systems. It will
						provide the skills you need to master this technique,
						as well as how to use the Unified Modelling Language
						(UML) to describe these models.
					</p>
					<li>Aim:</li>
					<p>
						To help you develop the critical skills to understand
						complex systems and problems and to create automated
						solutions.
					</p>
				</ol>
			<li><strong>CKIT518 Software testing and QA Management</strong></li>
				<!-- nested ordered list -->
				<ol>
					<li>Summary:</li>
					<p>
						This module provides the techniques you need to design
						and implement tests, conduct inspections and employ
						release and maintenance procedures. It also addresses
						key management aspects of the quality assurance process.
					</p>
					<li>Aim:</li>
					<p>
						To provide a thorough understanding of how to guarantee
						software quality, including testing, maintenance and
						effective management.
					</p>
				</ol>
			<li><strong>CKIT514 IT Project Management</strong></li>
				<!-- nested ordered list -->
				<ol>
					<li>Summary:</li>
					<p>
						This module shows how technology project management adapts
						to the evolution of a computer system from concept to
						implementation. You will master all areas of the subject,
						including organisation, work breakdown structure and
						scheduling, resources and project financing, project control
						and evaluation, management considerations, critical success
						factors and risk management.
					</p>
					<li>Aim:</li>
					<p>
						To provide a full understanding of the management roles,
						responsibilities and techniques needed in technology projects.
					</p>
